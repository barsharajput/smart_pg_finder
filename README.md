🧭 Problem Statement

Finding a suitable PG (Paying Guest accommodation) is often time-consuming and inefficient due to:

- ❌ Lack of filtering options
- ❌ No centralized booking system
- ❌ Poor user experience

This leads to decision fatigue and unreliable choices.

- Structured PG discovery
- Smart filtering based on user needs
- Seamless booking workflow
